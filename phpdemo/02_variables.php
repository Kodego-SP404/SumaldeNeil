/* --------- Variable Rules --------- */
/*
- Variables must be prefixed with $
- Variables must start with a letter or the underscore character
- variables can't start with a number
- Variables can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variables are case-sensitive ($name and $NAME are two different variables)
